Subject = Range[1,30];categorical
Activities = "WALKING","WALKING_UPSTAIRS","WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS","SITTING","STANDING","LAYING"

The remaining columns are averaged signal data for every Subject and Subject's Activity.

The training sets and testing sets were read in for Subject, X, and Y. 
The order of columns combined need to be Subjects, Y, X. 
The training set and testing set can be appended in any order.

Subsetting on columns were on standard deviation "std()" and mean "mean()", reducing
the amount of total columns to 66.
The subsetted table was then sorted on subject, then activity.

Activity levels were made more descriptive by changing the factors 1-6 to the levels shown above
in "Activities".

Column names were renamed to delete the dash marks and to capitalize either "mean" or "std".

Finally, the data was reduced by summarizing over the columns by averaging the activities by subject.
